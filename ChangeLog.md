To change, go to your preferences page and change the Buy Buffs Greeting to something like 'Hello {playername}, can I buy {buffs} for {cost} please?'.

Each time you refresh a page it will log the current titan kills (assuming x minutes has past - configurable - default 5). You can view the history on the scout tower screen. This is stage 1, once this is tested, I will work on the titan log to match the kills up to what you have in your log. [issue 916](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=916)

## [Revision 1133](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=1133) ##

## [Revision 1130](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=1130) ##
  1. (minor) FS: Update to the creature log to make it look and work better. The gold column was blocked, the font make smaller, highlighting added, background coloring added. Also added the ability to track enchancements. However, this only works with new sightings of the creatures. It should update your records though as you move around. Missing enchantments show up as Missing. [issue 932](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=932). [issue 934](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=934).

## [Revision 1129](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=1129) ##
  1. (minor) FS: Fix to Auto-Walk in mini map. Now it should show up correctly when you hit 'n'. However, it does not do anything to prevent you from walking into walls, so use at your own risk. [issue 928](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=928). [issue 931](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=931)

## [Revision 1128](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=1128) ##
  1. (MAJOR) FS: Added Auto-Walk in mini map. On the mini map (turned on by press "n"), draw a path starting from current player's position, then press "N" and watch your position moving along the drawn path. [issue 928](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=928)

## [Revision 1127](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=1127) ##
  1. (minor) FS: Added an option to only join groups of x size and smaller. Defaults to on and size 11. This means that they old 'Join All' button and links are replaced by a "Join All < x' button and functionality.

## [Revision 1124](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=1124) ##
  1. (minor) FS: Added option to turn off the auto scroll when shifting guild store pages (default on). If you have page elements hidden on the manage page then the scroll to guild store doesn't move to the right spot.

## [Revision 1123](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=1123) ##
  1. (minor) FS: Enhanced chat entry area (you can turn this functionality off in the options if you don't like it).
  1. (minor) FS: Added code to refresh the member list variable whenever you visit the guild.manage page. This should help the advisor have the correct ranks/levels. [issue 917](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=917)

  1. (minor) FS: Fixed bug introduced in the cross-browser fix from [r1119](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=1119) where three functions stopped working (calc relic stats, return to page after message and attack player extra widgets)

  1. (minor) FS: Added Best Damage wearing item check, accessible from any profile, "Check Items" link above the wearing set. The new screen will check the current wearing items with the Best Damage item available in the Ultimate Fallensword Guide, and show the result of the comparison. The items will be green if it is the best damage item (or in a full set), yellow if not. Please note that items are compared based on damange only, no other stats or set bonus is included.

The font was also tweaked to be more in line with the FSH version.

Does not differentiate between different forge levels or FF levels (so use at own risk - to the bulk list functionality a uncrafted 0FF Sword of Ursa is the same as a Perfect 5FF one - this is because of the way HCS labels their items). Defaults to disabled, you have to toggle a preference to turn it on. Need some testers please. I have tested this listing some potions, but would appreciate if others tested it too.

  1. (minor) FS: The guild member list updates every 5 mins if have the guild online list disabled (so correct lvls/ranks show in Advisor). [issue 475](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=475)

  1. (minor) SS2: Ported from FS: On the page where you spend your FC, I removed the ability to sell 1FC for 1k credit and put a link to the crystal market. I also added counters to both the + energy boxes that will show you how many stam you will get for the FC you type in (capped at the amount you have on hand).
  1. (minor) SS2: Fixed squad page, now it will display the local time that each squad will expire, an indicator of the min join level you have set for your squad, the level of leader, color the squad leader green if they were online, add button to show squad stats.

  1. (minor) FS: Fixed issue with new stamina calculator on the upgrade page if you had more than 999 FSP on hand (damn commas - wish I had more than 999 FSP and actually had this issue).
  1. (minor) FS: Fixed issue with relic calculator when one of the defenders was terminated or their profile no longer exists (although I am not sure what happens if the lead defender is terminated). This was happening at the Blue Chasm. [issue 516](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=516).
  1. (minor) FS: Hid the list of offline defenders if you did not own the relic (i.e. it is only for figuring out who is not currently defending an already held relic - it is pointless if you do not hold it).
  1. (minor) FS: Fixed level for Harvest quest (typo). [issue 550](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=550).
  1. (minor) FS: Fixed minor error when looking at an expired or terminated player.

## [Revision 700](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=700) ##

  1. (minor) FS: On the page where you spend your FSP, I removed the ability to sell 1FSP for 50k gold and put a link to the marketplace. I also added counters to both the + stam boxes that will show you how many stam you will get for the FSP you type in (capped at the amount you have on hand).

  1. (minor) FS: Fixed bug with Inventory Manager (personal and guild), that caused the wrong stats to be retrieved if a set was being worn. [issue 345](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=345).
  1. (minor) FS: Fixed bug with creature kill evaluator that used a static doubler level of 500 rather than the current doubler level to calculate the extra stamina being used.
  1. (minor) FS: Added a timer for both the inventory managers as both these functions have a lot of page hits (especially with large inventories). Guild inventory is set at 15 mins between refreshes, personal inventory 5 mins between refreshes. It also gives a count in seconds of how much longer you have to wait before you can refresh again. I applied this countdown to the Online Player page also.

## [Revision 693](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=693) ##
  1. (Major) FS: Added filters to the Guild Inventory Manager and the Personal Inventory Manager so you can filter out certain types of items (e.g. don't show me any Runes, etc). These filters all default to "show" so there should be no change to how things are displayed as default.
  1. (minor) FS: Updated a few items that were missing from the data file and updated code to deal with extra spaces at the start and end of item names (which HCS does sometimes).

## [Revision 692](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=692) ##

  1. (Major) FS: Updated creature evaluator to include Flinch, Nightmare Visage and Super Elite Slayer (only for super elites). [issue 537](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=537).

Also removed ignore link for guildmates (that would just be rude).

  1. (minor) FS: Another quick bug fix for the AH modifications made in [r636](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=636). If you did not have any quick searches set up to display on AH, then the AH screen would not show craft or FF values.

## [Revision 641](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=641) ##
  1. (minor) FS: Added functionality to hide arena prizes. Simply add the itemId to a comma separated list on the preferences screen and the item will be hidden.

  1. (Major) FS: Fixed the AH quick search so that the grid on the AH screen is editable. Maximum of 18 items can show up and you can configure the list that shows up on the AH quick search screen. I added a new parameter called "displayOnAH" and this has to be set for a quick search to show up on the AH page. Hopefully this should not be too hard for people to figure out how to use. You can always reset your AH quick search page to get a list to show up (make sure you save your old one first to notepad or something). [issue 300](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=300)

## [Revision 602](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=602) ##
  1. (minor) FS. [issue 384](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=384). Bio Compressor.

  1. (minor) FS: Updated script to prevent do not kill from showing creature in red if you are not using the quick kill function.

  1. (minor) Re-added the second way to detect advisor page. Should only work in index.php (without ?xxx=yyy) now ([issue 374](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=374)).

  1. (minor) FS. Added a do not kill list on the preferences screen. Comma separated list, the creature will show up as red on the world screen and also the keyboard functions for killing this type of creature have been blocked (you just get a message saying it is on your do not kill list) ([issue 170](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=170)).

  1. (minor) SS2: Updated mission manager data ([issue 323](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=323)).

## [Revision 521](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=521) ##

  1. (minor) FS: [issue 317](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=317). Fixed recall message from GS if bags are full. Also fixed recall from report page if GS is full or someone else already recalled the item.
  1. (minor) FS: [issue 306](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=306). Changed the color in the AH for Excellent items as it was hard to see the color against the background. Perfect now show up as green and Excellent show up as yellow.

## [Revision 520](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=520) ##
  1. (Major) FS: Add buff pack in Quick Buff page, add buttons to select all buffs, clear all.

## [Revision 519](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=519) ##

## [Revision 516](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=516) ##
  1. (minor) FS. PvP Arena change. Minor change to the columns that show up on the join or view results pages to only show the relevant ones (i.e. don't show players or state as they are old). Currently saved matches will not show up with this new method, but new ones will. Also on the join page it will show your current combat move setup (actual current setup, not the saved one).

## [Revision 514](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=514) ##
  1. (Major) FS - PvP Arena. The Helper now saves details on the arenas as you view them and then displays that info on the Join/View pages. This allows you to see on the join and results page details of the actual match (level, prize, specials, etc). It will only work for those arenas which you actually view in the first page and only saves the last 1000 (purges old ones as it goes)
  1. (minor) FS - quick buff. Quest Finder would not color green correctly if you only had one point in the skill.
  1. (minor) FS - calculate relic stats. [issue 259](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/issues/detail?id=259). Added code to show any players in your guild not at the relic. This really is only useful for guilds who are guarding a relic and want to know who is not pulling their weight. Exceptions are made for levels where players use obscene amounts of stamina to return (e.g. Xind 400-420).

## [Revision 512](https://code.google.com/p/fallenswordhelper/source/detail?r=512) ##
  1. (Major) FS. On the pvp arena page, I added the ability to hide matches for moves you already have 3 of via a checkbox. Note that this function will not start working until you have visited the page that shows you how many of each move you have. I also removed the current combat moves setup off this screen as it had potential to show the wrong set of combat moves if you log in to more than one computer. I will do something about fixing this later.
