Q: How does quick kill work?

A: It's quite easy. When "single" is selected, keys 1-8 on the keyboard kill creatures without displaying a different page. The battle result is displayed in place, and details are displayed when you mouse over the result. When you select "type", this works the same as "single", except that all creatures of the same name (out of the 8 creatures displayed, of course) are also killed.

Q: What are the numbers in parentheses at the right of the gold gained? (e.g. "XP:123 Gold:91 (23)")

A: This is the guild tax, the money that goes to the guild.

Q: Can you auto repair after all kills?

A: After killing a screenful of monsters, repair is already automatically (and silently) called. Note that because AJAX is asynchronous (that is, I make the call to the page that kills the monster, but I don't wait until the monster is killed), there's no guarantee that the repair will really occur after all the kills.
This is the same for single and type settings. It should repair after each single or each type has completed.

Q: What do the colors on the guild members list mean?

A: White is for normal. Dark orange means the member has just logged in. Gold denotes yourself (to find yourself easily and e.g. buff yourself)
