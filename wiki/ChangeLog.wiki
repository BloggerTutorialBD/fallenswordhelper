(To be tidied up if someone has time and energy).
  # Holds a list with the current guild, friendly guilds, old guilds and enemy guilds, so that when you see a profile for member of either guild, a message appears under their name (color and message are customizable).
  # When you try to dispose of an item (optionally), it retrieves data from the server to find out about the item color, and paints the text of the item with that color. This makes it easy to get rid of e.g. all white (common) items. There's even an option to disable this.
  # Displays a list of all members of the guild that are currently online, when at the world or chat pages. You can directly buff a player from that list. Any player that has logged in in the last 15 seconds or so, is displayed in yellow (in order to reduce the calls to the server, I don't update the guild list if it has been updated less than 15 seconds ago).
  # I also incorporated the code and functionality from Fallensword Buffing, with a bit of extra functionality for guild administrators.
  # Optionally (go to Character > Preferences to enable this) kills all monsters on the spot.
  # Improved kill functionality - you can optionally kill monsters as usual but with no new page opening, kill all monsters of a single type, or kill every monster on the square you just moved to.
  # In guild management report page, the list of guild members is used to show which members are online.
  # In auction house pages, text about the offered item is automatically retrieved.
  # In guild groups page, statistics about each group are automatically retrieved. Also the level of the group creator.
  # You can hide the top banner and some guild info (to get to the "good part").
  # You can see shield imps and if you're missing hunting buffs at the world page.
  # You can see relic notification when you're about to capture a relic.
  # There is a relic defender calculator, that does everything except check for inactive players.
  # The logs are colored based on the age of the message. New messages since your last visit are yellow background, messages older than 20 minutes will have a brown background. This works for guild chat, guild log and player chat.
  # On the player log screen, it adds a link to trade with the player between Reply and Buff. It also colors guildmate names green.
  # When on the drop item page, you can immediately search the item in the auction house, or even sell it.
  # On the questbook page all completed quests are hidden and all incomplete quests from other pages are also loaded and displayed (optional).
  # The preferences page have some mouseover help.
  # Finally, it is able to auto update itself (it checks once a day or you can check manually).
