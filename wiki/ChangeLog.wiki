=A version by version list of changes made to the script=

==Revision 806==
  # (minor) SS2: Added artifact data (viewable when mouseover the Artifact image in Artifact list).

==Revision 805==
  # (Major) FS: Ported from SS2: Guild Inventory Manager is clickable, click on an item will go to the report page with that item filtered; click on (set) will search for items of the same set (issue 669)

==Revision 804==
  # (minor) SS2: Updated Mission Manager for new Content  

==Revision 803==
  # (minor) FS: Updated the script so that it works when you click on the upgrades page when you go to it via the purple dots button at the top of the screen. issue 311
  # (minor) FS: Added quick links to Trade and Secure trade to enable users to select different catagories of items (all, all plants, individual plants). Work in progress. I hope to make it work for all guild items, and different potions too. Thought is required before doing more though.

==Revision 801==
  # (Major) SS2: Ported functionality to bulk list items on the AH from FS. Works for one type of item at a time. Does not differentiate between different augmentation levels or FE (engineering) levels (so use at own risk). Defaults to disabled, you have to toggle a Config to turn it on.
  # (minor) SS2: Added Shortcut key "I" (shift+i) to remove Mental Strength for Purists. 

==Revision 800==
  # (major) FS: Added functionality to bulk list items on the AH. Works for one type of item at a time (so more suited to potion sellers). Does not differentiate between different forge levels or FF levels (so use at own risk - to the bulk list functionality a uncrafted 0FF Sword of Ursa is the same as a Perfect 5FF one - this is because of the way HCS labels their items). Defaults to disabled, you have to toggle a preference to turn it on. Need some testers please. I have tested this listing some potions, but would appreciate if others tested it too. issue 311.
  # (minor) FS: Updated player online list to remove duplicates (I think).

==Revision 798==

  # (minor) FS: Hid the list of offline defenders if you did not own the relic (i.e. it is only for figuring out who is not currently defending an already held relic - it is pointless if you do not hold it).
  # (minor) FS: Fixed level for Harvest quest (typo). issue 550.
  # (minor) FS: Fixed minor error when looking at an expired or terminated player.

==Revision 700==
  # (minor) FS: Added "Bid no Refresh" button to the AH. If you use this button it will place your bid, but not refresh the screen (similar to fast wear, fast take, etc). issue 530.
  # (minor) FS: On the page where you spend your FSP, I removed the ability to sell 1FSP for 50k gold and put a link to the marketplace. I also added counters to both the + stam boxes that will show you how many stam you will get for the FSP you type in (capped at the amount you have on hand).
  # (minor) FS: Fixed minor bug. issue 539

==Revision 698==

  # (minor) FS: Fixed bug with creature kill evaluator that used a static doubler level of 500 rather than the current doubler level to calculate the extra stamina being used.
  # (minor) FS: Added a timer for both the inventory managers as both these functions have a lot of page hits (especially with large inventories). Guild inventory is set at 15 mins between refreshes, personal inventory 5 mins between refreshes. It also gives a count in seconds of how much longer you have to wait before you can refresh again. I applied this countdown to the Online Player page also.

==Revision 693==
  # (major) FS: Added filters to the Guild Inventory Manager and the Personal Inventory Manager so you can filter out certain types of items (e.g. don't show me any Runes, etc). These filters all default to "show" so there should be no change to how things are displayed as default.
  # (minor) FS: Updated a few items that were missing from the data file and updated code to deal with extra spaces at the start and end of item names (which HCS does sometimes).

==Revision 692==

  # (minor) SS2: Addition to credits

Also made it so that [ Reply | etc | Buff ] is not split between lines (looked funny to me). Also removed ignore link for guildmates (that would just be rude).

==Revision 643==
  # (minor) FS: Another quick bug fix for the AH modifications made in r636. If you did not have any quick searches set up to display on AH, then the AH screen would not show craft or FF values.

==Revision 641==

I added a new parameter called "displayOnAH" and this has to be set for a quick search to show up on the AH page. Hopefully this should not be too hard for people to figure out how to use. You can always reset your AH quick search page to get a list to show up (make sure you save your old one first to notepad or something). issue 300

==Revision 633==

==Revision 602==
  # (minor) FS. issue 384. Bio Compressor. Shortens other players bio's and puts a More ... link so you can expand the rest of the bio (so you don't have to scroll to the bottom of the page for long bios).

  # (minor) Fixed cosmetic issues with monster log.

  # (minor) FS. Fixed quick wear if you had quest item or potion in your bag for items that showed up after that potion or quest item (issue 363).
  # (minor) FS. Added a do not kill list on the preferences screen. Comma separated list, the creature will show up as red on the world screen and also the keyboard functions for killing this type of creature have been blocked (you just get a message saying it is on your do not kill list) (issue 170).

==Revision 543==
  # (minor) Changes now are shown inline, not in an alert box. The window is scrollable, and Ok is always visible. (issue 330)
  # (minor) Some work to perhaps remove problems with the Helper not updating. I'm trying to manually download the scripts first. It works for me, but I never had that problem anyway. Someone else should test it.

==Revision 542==

==Revision 516==
  # (minor) FS. PvP Arena change. Minor change to the columns that show up on the join or view results pages to only show the relevant ones (i.e. don't show players or state as they are old). Currently saved matches will not show up with this new method, but new ones will. Also on the join page it will show your current combat move setup (actual current setup, not the saved one).

==Revision 514==
  # (Major) FS - PvP Arena. The Helper now saves details on the arenas as you view them and then displays that info on the Join/View pages. This allows you to see on the join and results page details of the actual match (level, prize, specials, etc). It will only work for those arenas which you actually view in the first page and only saves the last 1000 (purges old ones as it goes)
  # (minor) FS - quick buff. Quest Finder would not color green correctly if you only had one point in the skill.
  # (minor) FS - calculate relic stats. issue 259. Added code to show any players in your guild not at the relic. This really is only useful for guilds who are guarding a relic and want to know who is not pulling their weight. Exceptions are made for levels where players use obscene amounts of stamina to return (e.g. Xind 400-420).

==Revision 512==
  # (Major) FS. On the pvp arena page, I added the ability to hide matches for moves you already have 3 of via a checkbox. Note that this function will not start working until you have visited the page that shows you how many of each move you have. I also removed the current combat moves setup off this screen as it had potential to show the wrong set of combat moves if you log in to more than one computer. I will do something about fixing this later.

==Revision 487==
