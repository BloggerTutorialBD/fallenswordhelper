Each time you refresh a page it will log the current titan kills (assuming x minutes has past - configurable - default 5). You can view the history on the scout tower screen. This is stage 1, once this is tested, I will work on the titan log to match the kills up to what you have in your log. issue 916

  # (minor) FS: Enhanced chat entry area (you can turn this functionality off in the options if you don't like it).
  # (minor) FS: Added code to refresh the member list variable whenever you visit the guild.manage page. This should help the advisor have the correct ranks/levels. issue 917

  # (minor) FS: Added a few more items to the data file (although I hope HCS implements soon so that I can remove this functionality and make the helper faster).

==Revision 1115==
  # (minor) FS: Added Best Damage wearing item check, accessible from any profile, "Check Items" link above the wearing set. The new screen will check the current wearing items with the Best Damage item available in the Ultimate Fallensword Guide, and show the result of the comparison.

  # (minor) SS2: Changed BP compact screen to 4 items per line with more info displayed.

==Revision 1108==

Privs that most people should have (e.g. view advisor, store items, etc) have a low rank (0.1), privs that only a few should have (un-tag, withdraw gold, etc) have a high weighting (5), the rest are between. It was intended as an easy way to sum up who has to little or too many privs for each rank.

==Revision 1065==
  # (minor) FS: Fix for AH item widgets not showing up in the AH after the last fix.

==Revision 1063==
  # (Major) FS: Removed FSH guild chat sidebar in favor of HCS version. If you have not tried it yet, turn it on and try it, they did a good job with the update.
  # (minor) FS: Added option to enable the fetching of item stats (craft/forge/durability) in the AH. Note this is DEFAULT TO OFF so if you like this functionality, you will need to go turn it back on again in the preferences. I turned it off because it is extra load on HCS servers and should only really be used if you make use of it.
  # (minor) FS: Added code so that if you click on an item image in the AH, it will do a search for that item (e.g. if you are looking at someones auction listings and you want to know if their prices are reasonable, you can just click the image to do a search)

The font was also tweaked to be more in line with the FSH version.

  # (minor) FS: Added an option to enable the icon for the FSG on the world screen. This will allow those who have edited their hosts file to get the FSG working to use the icon again.
  # (minor) FS: Changed the default of the countdown timer to off. You should turn this off unless you really need it as it is a memory hog. I recommend using the FS plugin instead (http://koti.kapsi.fi/~tharna/fallensword/). issue 815

==Revision 1018==

  # IMPORTANT! The helper version of the chat in the sidebar will be removed about 2 weeks from now. There will be a post in the forum to discuss it. The reason for the removal is that it causes an extra page hit (to the chat page) each load which is unnecessary as HCS has implemented a version that works.

Does not differentiate between different forge levels or FF levels (so use at own risk - to the bulk list functionality a uncrafted 0FF Sword of Ursa is the same as a Perfect 5FF one - this is because of the way HCS labels their items).

Guild inventory is set at 15 mins between refreshes, personal inventory 5 mins between refreshes. It also gives a count in seconds of how much longer you have to wait before you can refresh again. I applied this countdown to the Online Player page also.

==Revision 693==
  # (Major) FS: Added filters to the Guild Inventory Manager and the Personal Inventory Manager so you can filter out certain types of items (e.g. don't show me any Runes, etc). These filters all default to "show" so there should be no change to how things are displayed as default.
  # (minor) FS: Updated a few items that were missing from the data file and updated code to deal with extra spaces at the start and end of item names (which HCS does sometimes).

==Revision 692==

Also made it so that [ Reply | etc | Buff ] is not split between lines (looked funny to me). Also removed ignore link for guildmates (that would just be rude).

==Revision 668==

  # (Major) FS: Fixed the AH quick search so that the grid on the AH screen is editable. Maximum of 18 items can show up and you can configure the list that shows up on the AH quick search screen. I added a new parameter called "displayOnAH" and this has to be set for a quick search to show up on the AH page. Hopefully this should not be too hard for people to figure out how to use. You can always reset your AH quick search page to get a list to show up (make sure you save your old one first to notepad or something). issue 300

==Revision 633==
  # (minor) Fixed case where a backslash ("\") would break drop item page (issue 449).

Everyone who has a problem with updating Sigma Storm Helper this should go click here [<a href="http://fallenswordhelper.googlecode.com/svn-history/r606/trunk/sigmastormhelper.user.js">direct installation</a>] instead of pressing ok.

==Revision 602==
  # (minor) FS. issue 384. Bio Compressor. Shortens other players bio's and puts a More ... link so you can expand the rest of the bio (so you don't have to scroll to the bottom of the page for long bios). Defaults to off, default settings for bio to show are 1500 characters or 25 lines (whichever is shorter) and you can change these settings.

==Revision 595==
  # (minor) FS: Fixed missing function in Preferences (showMonsterLog)

  # (minor) FS: Fixed coloring of Super Elites (hopefully - I haven't seen any SE yet :))
  # (minor) Made links to the site more prominent.
  # (minor) Changed the default for quick kill to true (this will affect new players mostly - I hope all current players know you can enable quick kill [not quick kill by type - that's gone!] from preferences).
  # (minor) FS: Fixed issue with image not appearing on mouseover of the "view creature" button.
  # (minor) Fixed cosmetic issues with monster log.

==Revision 589==
  # (minor) FS: Updated script to prevent do not kill from showing creature in red if you are not using the quick kill function. The do not kill functionality only works if you are using the keyboard to kill and only if quick kill is enabled (issue 376).

==Revision 588==
  # (minor) SS2: fixed the quick-change combat set (shortcut Shift+1, etc.) after the update

==Revision 587==
  # (Major) FS: Modified Inventory Manager (personal and guild) to add data from rubicksman's item list. You can now view and sort by where the item is and also by item type (gloves, helmet etc).
  # (minor) FS: Cut down fsData.js for size.
  # (minor) FS: Removed inventory html, which was not used anywhere but was making the collected data way too big (4 MB for my guild, cut down to 0.4MB after that).

==Revision 577==
  # (minor) FS. Fixed quick wear if you had quest item or potion in your bag for items that showed up after that potion or quest item (issue 363).
  # (minor) FS. Added a do not kill list on the preferences screen. Comma separated list, the creature will show up as red on the world screen and also the keyboard functions for killing this type of creature have been blocked (you just get a message saying it is on your do not kill list) (issue 170).

==Revision 576==
  # (Major) Add shortcut "P" to go to profile page (issue 370).

==Revision 575==

==Revision 543==
  # (minor) Changes now are shown inline, not in an alert box. The window is scrollable, and Ok is always visible. (issue 330)
  # (minor) Some work to perhaps remove problems with the Helper not updating. I'm trying to manually download the scripts first. It works for me, but I never had that problem anyway. Someone else should test it.
  # (minor) Some synchronisation from FS to SS2 and vice versa (see the Character -> Preferences for example)

==Revision 542==
  # (minor) SS2: Synchornised SS2 with Quick Link function in SS

  # (minor) FS: Added item list in fsData.js (not used right now)

  # (minor) fix an error prevent clearing combat log when this log is large

==Revision 521==
  # (minor) FS: Fix for hiding arena matches you already have the moves for (rows did not hide correctly before).
  # (minor) FS: issue 317. Fixed recall message from GS if bags are full. Also fixed recall from report page if GS is full or someone else already recalled the item.
  # (minor) FS: issue 306. Changed the color in the AH for Excellent items as it was hard to see the color against the background. Perfect now show up as green and Excellent show up as yellow.

==Revision 520==

==Revision 519==
  # (minor) Online Player only get the most recently online players (last 20% in FS, 33% in SS2), and disable refresh for 5 minutes (issue 315)

==Revision 516==
  # (minor) FS. PvP Arena change. Minor change to the columns that show up on the join or view results pages to only show the relevant ones (i.e. don't show players or state as they are old). Currently saved matches will not show up with this new method, but new ones will. Also on the join page it will show your current combat move setup (actual current setup, not the saved one).

==Revision 514==
  # (Major) FS - PvP Arena. The Helper now saves details on the arenas as you view them and then displays that info on the Join/View pages. This allows you to see on the join and results page details of the actual match (level, prize, specials, etc). It will only work for those arenas which you actually view in the first page and only saves the last 1000 (purges old ones as it goes)
  # (minor) FS - quick buff. Quest Finder would not color green correctly if you only had one point in the skill.
  # (minor) FS - calculate relic stats. issue 259. Added code to show any players in your guild not at the relic. This really is only useful for guilds who are guarding a relic and want to know who is not pulling their weight. Exceptions are made for levels where players use obscene amounts of stamina to return (e.g. Xind 400-420).

==Revision 512==
  # (Major) FS. On the pvp arena page, I added the ability to hide matches for moves you already have 3 of via a checkbox. Note that this function will not start working until you have visited the page that shows you how many of each move you have. I also removed the current combat moves setup off this screen as it had potential to show the wrong set of combat moves if you log in to more than one computer. I will do something about fixing this later.
