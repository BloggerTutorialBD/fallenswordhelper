# Requirements #

In order to use Fallen Sword Helper, you will need Firefox 3.5 and Greasemonkey. It doesn't work with IE, because I'm using scripting methods that IE doesn't have (such as document.evaluate), it doesn't work with Chrome because with Greasemetal doesn't have some basic Greasemonkey functionality (such as saving and reading variables, and using XMLHTTP). It may work with Firefox 2, but I would strongly recommend upgrading to Firefox 3.5. It may still work for 3.0, but you should still upgrade to 3.5 unless you have a good reason for not doing so.

# Quick installation guide #

For help in installing, look at [Userscripts.org guide](http://userscripts.org/about/installing). In short: [Firefox](http://getfirefox.com/) (preferably version 4+) and [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/748) are required. Or just Chrome [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome)

For more information, see [UserScripts.org Guide](http://userscripts.org/about/installing)
